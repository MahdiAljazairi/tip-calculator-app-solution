## My process

### Hardest part

Managing all the alerts systematically was the most troublesome part of the process. But this project gave me confidence to work with Javascript.

### What I learned

Programming is so damn HARD!.

Also, the `in` operator tests presence of keys/indexes, not values. Learned the hard way.

## Tools

- [Dev Docs](https://devdocs.io) - The resource I was constantly referring to throughout the process. It's an offline web app that has a huge collection of documentations.
- [Brackets](https://brackets.io) - My text editor. Not as powerful as VSCode, but still my favorite.
- Chrome - This web page was only tested on Chrome.
